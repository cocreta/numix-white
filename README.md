Based on numix circle.

numix white received a massive downvoting in opendesktop.org so I decided to remove it from there. 

it's not my fault if plasma-desktop can't handle icon themes very well. 

I posted this icon theme at gnome look and opendesktop made it available for plasma users. 
Tested it on plasma and worked fine but for some people not then the downvoting started.  

And, I do not allow to post it there anymore.
